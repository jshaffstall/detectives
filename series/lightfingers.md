Our thief is a teen known only as Lightfingers.  Lightfingers grew up in the streets of a medieval city.  This is no normal medieval city, but one where magic is known and used, at least by the rich and powerful.  Lightfingers has no magic, so turned to thievery to survive and soon became an accomplished thief.  

At times you'll help Lightfingers steal jewels from evil men, or to help the downtrodden of the city.  Along the way you'll encounter mysterious creatures and strange magics.  

It's up to you to help Lightfingers succeed!
