            "text": "The Detectives Guild was born out of a long tradition of Christmas treasure hunts for our daughter. Each Christmas, and later birthdays as well, one of the presents would be hidden behind a trail of riddles that would take her all through the house finding hidden clues.  The clues would eventually lead to the present hidden somewhere in the house. Later, these riddle chains led not only through the house, but through town, requiring her to interact with store clerks to give code phrases to receive the next clue. The Detectives Guild started as a way to give other kids that same sort of experience electronically, but has evolved to be far more than that.  Fairly quickly it grew to support Choose Your Own Adventure sorts of mysteries along with the more standard riddle and puzzle solving type, along with expanding the mysteries to ones suitable for adults, too. The only limit now is our authors' creativity!",

            "text": "What Is The Detective's Guild? The Detectives Guild provides interactive mysteries you can give as gifts to the Detectives in your life, including you! Our mysteries are played entirely online with no registration required for the Detectives themselves. When you purchase a mystery you provide a name for them to be known by in the mystery (that doesn't need to be their real name). The only other information we collect during the mystery are their answers to each stage. Some mysteries will involve solving ciphers and riddles, while others will involve playing through a branching story. Our mysteries span age ranges and skill levels, from the youngest beginning sleuths to the most mature Detectives. Browse our mysteries by specific Category or Series with the links to the right, or click The Mysteries in the navigation to see a comprehensive list.",
