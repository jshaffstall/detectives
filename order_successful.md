### You've Bought Your Order, What Next?

Each mystery you bought will need to be assigned to a Detective so that we can email them instructions on how to play it.  You can assign Detectives  by going to the My Account link at the top of the page.  

Be sure to log in using the same email you entered when you checked out.  Then click on Pending Orders.  In the Unassigned Orders section click on the order itself and you'll be able to assign Detectives to each mystery in the order.  

If you have any troubles, click the Support link and let us know what's going on.  We'll do our best to fix it.
