If you're reading this close to when it was posted, the site you're on is the beta-test version of the Detectives Guild website.  

Everything is in test mode, including purchasing mysteries.  If you're a beta-tester, you'll have been given the information needed to go through the purchase of a mystery.

If you're not a beta-tester, but want to be, join our Discord server and request access.  Be sure to let us know how you found the site, since we're not advertising it yet.

We're super excited about the beta-test launch.  Detectives Guild has been a multi-year labor of love to provide virtual mysteries to Detectives of all ages.  

Thanks for joining us!
