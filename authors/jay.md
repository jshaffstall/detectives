Jay loves technology, roleplaying, and time travel, so it's no surprise that his mysteries tend to involve riddles and puzzles, along with time travel.  

Jay's first introduction to mysteries was with the Three Investigators series of novels.  He fell so in love with the series that he had his Dad print him his very own investigative business cards.

While he never did solve any mysteries around town, that initial love of mysteries led to a love of puzzles and problem solving, and authoring mysteries at the Detectives Guild.
