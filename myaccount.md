A separate web app is used to manage your purchases and assign Detectives to mysteries you purchase.  You can't really do much on the app until you've made a purchase.

You do want to make sure to make the purchase with the same email you plan to use for your account on the account app.  That way the app can easily find the mysteries you've purchased.
