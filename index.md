## What Is The Detective's Guild?

The Detectives Guild provides interactive mysteries you can give as gifts to the Detectives in your life, including you!

Our mysteries are played entirely online with no registration required for the Detectives themselves. When you purchase a mystery you provide a name for them to be known by in the mystery (that doesn't need to be their real name). The only other information we collect during the mystery are their answers to each stage.

Some mysteries will involve solving ciphers and riddles, while others will involve playing through a branching story. Our mysteries span age ranges and skill levels, from the youngest beginning sleuths to the most mature Detectives.

Browse our mysteries by specific Category or Series with the links to the right, or click The Mysteries in the navigation to see a comprehensive list.
