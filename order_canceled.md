### You Didn't Finish Paying For Your Order

If you changed your mind about the order, no problem!  If at some point you decide you want to complete the order, click the My Account link at the top of the page.  

Be sure to log in using the same email you entered when you checked out.  Then click on Pending Orders.  In the Pending Orders section click on the order itself and you'll go back to the screen where you can pay for the order.

If you decide you don't want the order anymore, you can click the X to the right of the order to abandon it permanently.

If you have any troubles, click the Support link and let us know what's going on.  We'll do our best to fix it.
