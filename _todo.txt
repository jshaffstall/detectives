TODO
----

Rework templates to separate out the menu text from the h1 text

Build the templates for the listing of all categories and series

Need some filter for returning all the series or categories, not just one.  
Maybe a wildcard on the existing filters?

Allow iframes to request that the parent window reload all the other iframes.  
Would be used when an iframe triggers a change in login/logout state that would
require other iframes to be reloaded to pick up the new state.

-should be able to use window.parent.postMessage to send message to parent
 window.  Send some way of the parent window knowing which iframe send the 
 message.  The parent window can reload the other iframes using the technique
 that avoids creating history elements.
 
-The window.parent.postMessage happens inside the Anvil forms.  The static site
 must listen for the message and reload other iframes.  Need a class for iframes
 that should be reloaded on these state changes.  Give each iframe an id that allows
 the one that generated the message to not be reloaded
