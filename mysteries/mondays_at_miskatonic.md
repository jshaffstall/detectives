This mystery takes place on the campus of Miskatonic University.

This version of Miskatonic University is lighter than that depicted in HP Lovecraft's stories, but still offers classes in such diverse topics as Tissue Reanimation, Applied Mythology, Esoteric Studies, and more.  

When a visiting high school student finds themselves repeating the worst of all days, Monday, can they figure out what's causing it and escape?
